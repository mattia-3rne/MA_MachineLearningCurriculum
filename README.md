# MA_MachineLearningCurriculum
 
📘 A collection of machine learning programs designed as part of my Matura thesis to introduce high school students to fundamental ML concepts.

## Overview
This repository contains four machine learning projects developed to provide hands-on examples of core machine learning algorithms. The programs cover supervised and unsupervised learning, offering practical insights into how algorithms operate on data.

The curriculum aims to make machine learning accessible for high school students, focusing on simplicity, clarity, and educational value. Each program includes essential comments to help students and teachers understand the code and underlying concepts.

## Projects Included
### 1. Linear Regression (Supervised Learning)
📈 A simple implementation of linear regression to demonstrate how models can predict continuous outcomes by fitting a line to data points.

Concepts: Gradient descent (optional), sum of squared error (SSE), model fitting.
Use Case: Predicting participation in class based on caffeine intake.

### 2. Decision Tree Classification (Supervised Learning)
🌳 A program that builds a decision tree to classify data into distinct categories based on input features.

Concepts: Entropy, information gain, recursive partitioning.
Use Case: Classifying students based on exam performance and study hours.

### 3. K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
🎯 An implementation of the K-means algorithm that groups data into clusters by iteratively refining centroid positions.

Concepts: Clustering, centroid initialization, within-cluster variance.
Use Case: Segmenting homework based on difficulty and number of pages.

### 4. Naive Bayes Text Prediction (Unsupervised Learning)
📝 A Naive Bayes-based text prediction program that uses probabilities to predict the next word in a sequence based on prior text data.

Concepts: Bayes' theorem, conditional probability, text classification.
Use Case: Generating a number of words after a given input.
